## Notable changes from MCO1 to MCO2
1. The languages used in the application changed from base HTML to using React and Express built with Vite.
2. The application now uses TypeScript. It is highly recommended to download `Error Lens` on VS Code or any plugins for error detection, as TypeScript can be strict with its data types and syntax. 
3. The application now has a database connected to it via MongoDB. 
4. The application implemented MVC architecture.

## How to set up
1. Clone the repository on VS Code or open with GitHub desktop. Else, you may download the ZIP file, then extract it. 
2. Open the folder and type `npm install` into the terminal to install all relevant packages.
  - If you get errors where some packages are not installed, install them manually. 
  - If you add packages, make sure `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files are updated, and notify everyone so we can download the modules added.
  - BTW there's like at least 5k files in node_modules when you download the packages, so don't delete the .gitignore file
3. To start the project, just type in `npm run dev` to run the server at `localhost:3000`
4. That's pretty much it, glhf
